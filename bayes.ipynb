    "# Bayesian Updating\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that runs scored by each team are both random variables that follow a Weibull distribution. We follow the scientific research in the field to determine the shape parameter of the underlying Weibull distribution. Having fixed that parameter, in the first simulation, we assume that the scale paramater of the underlying Weibull distribution for each team is equal to the average runs that they have scored through their last game. In the second simulation, we use an alternative approach where this scale parameter for each team is determined through a continuous `Bayesian` updating process. The general idea is that we form a `prior` belief about the expected runs that a team can score at the beginning of the season. Then, as the season progresses, by observing the number of runs that they score in each game, we `update` our belief about their future peroformance. This updated belief, is then, used for simulation and prediction of their next game.\n",

In other words, consider the following Weibull random variable\n",
