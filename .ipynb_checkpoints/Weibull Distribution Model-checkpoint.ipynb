    "The goal of this notebook is to build a model to predict the winner of a baseball game using the data gathered as a season goes forward. The main idea of rather using the Pythagorean Expectation is to use the idea of Steven J. Miller's paper \"A Derivation of the Pythagorean Won-Lose Formula in Baseball\" (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0509698.pdf). However, rather using the actual Pythagorean Expectation as our measure of whether or not a team will win, we will use the empirical observation that the Pythagorean Expectation is a good approximation for the actual win percentage in baseball. Furthermore, as the paper shows the Pythagorean Expectation gives the precise win percentage when we make the assumption that the runs scored and runs allowed follow Weibull distributions with given parameters. Thus, the idea of the model will be to use this observation, so for any particular game between two games look at how the teams previously did throughout the season to determine what the appropriate parameters for their Weibull distribution will be for that particular game. Then we shall simulate several games for how many runs will be scored by each team using these distributions to predict who will win the game. "

Primarily, we have added a cumulative runs scored and allowed columns which consist of the cumulative runs scored and allowed before that particular game (thus for the first game each team will have 0 to initialize). We have used these cumulative runs/scored and allowed to calculate the Weibull distribution parameters at that point in the season."

Furthermore, per the commment the variable $\\beta$ is just a translation which has no affect if we assume that it is constant in all cases (and was included, so that the ideas may be extrapolated to other sports with higher scoring games). For baseball Miller takes $\\beta=-.5$, so that the bins are centered at integers. Thus, we shall take these variables to be constant throughout.
